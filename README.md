A Minecraft BDS plugin,based LiteLoaderBDS.

Allow servers with online-mode=false (such as WeaterDog downstream servers) to enable white list plugin.

It can:
- Prevent unauthorized players from joining the server.
- Self managing the list of players that can be added.
- More Coming soon...

All the above are implemented under the condition of online-mode=false.
However, in the vanilla BDS, onlie-mode=false cannot do this.
But, in LiteLoaderBDS, supported by LiteloaderBDS.NET, we have achieved!

Welcome to use the FantasyTownAllowlist produced by the FantasyTown Minecraft Bedrock Edition server development team!
